### This is my first post

I haven't done a blog before. This post will mark the beginning on a journey, long or short. Dont really know yet.

Today I installed alot of programs and updated my windows since I hade the lowly home-edition... not good.
But now I have a professional version with alot of stuff baked in the cake.
However, when I payed the price for the program and updated it, I saw no difference at all... that was not very 
fulfilling. But Docker worked and that atleast showed me I had professional. But when I added docker, nothing was 
showing either, no program, no nothing. Just a little blipp down in the corner, thats that then.

Oh joy!
