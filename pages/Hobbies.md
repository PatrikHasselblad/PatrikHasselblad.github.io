# Lots of hobbies

I like fish & potatoes!

In my spare-time, the days I have spare-time, I usually sit infront of the TV.

There are, however, things that I like to do.

Fishing is one, but I haven't done that for years, its a pitty. Now it is winter and can't say that am rushing for it now, 
but in the spring perhaps.

Other than that, I really like music and used to play alot when I was younger. Now I have thick fingers and have issues playing 
the guitar... ah, aging, isn't it wonderful?
