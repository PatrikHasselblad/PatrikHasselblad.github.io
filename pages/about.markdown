### Here you will find some very basic information about me.

I grew up a long, long time ago, before we even had computers in our homes. Instead we used to be outdoors; fishing, biking, 
taking apples from neighbours trees. Just common stuff.

I live outside of Stockholm with my family; 2 children and a fianc√©e.

Programming and system development has always been an interest of mine but opening the big brick-books has always been somewhat 
tedious. So it always ended up on the shelf.

I worked as a truck driver for 10-15 years, but always felt that it wasn't really that much fun. When yet another re-shaping of 
the company I worked at was about to happen, I decided to leave and try my wings. I had no previous education so I had to start 
from the beginning. Now it has been 3-4 years of studies and I am slowly getting there.
